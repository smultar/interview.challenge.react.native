Welcome to the interview challenge repository for React Native! This repo contains a solution for the given challenge, implemented using React Native. Here's what you'll find inside:

`App.jsx`: This is the entry point for the app. It contains the code for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions.

`components`: This directory contains the React Native components that make up the user interface of the app.

`utils`: This directory contains utility functions that are used throughout the app.

To run the app, you'll need to have React Native installed on your machine. Once you've done that, simply clone this repository and run npm install to install the required dependencies. Then, you can run the app on an emulator or device by running `react-native run-android` (for Android) or `react-native run-ios` (for iOS).

I hope you enjoy exploring this solution to the challenge! If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to open an issue in this repository. Happy coding!

PS.
I also added my design files into the repository, so you can explore that as well. Since designing is heavily apart of my coding process.
